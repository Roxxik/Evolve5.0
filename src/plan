step 0:
    write own forth definition check
step 0.5:
    write a forth lexer/parser
    //skip this just write a printer all forth programs will be generated
step 0.9:
    write a forth interpreter without registers and a reduced instuction set
step 1:
    write a forth interpreter
step 2:
    write a simple environemnt and some simple environment calls
    2.1:build a simple environment(ala array with pointers to cells and cells)



step n-1:
    ???

step n:
    profit

//TODO
check for leaks
generate code blocks
deleting organisms
add seed
add eat
some sort of global energy to draw from

more efficient field

decide wich mutations to use
maybe add selfmodifiying capabilities
    is a child getting the initial code of parent or the code at birth?
adding gender
adding multitasking within a cell
add more reflection
    get stacksizes


//DONE
more bitwise operations(shifting)//first define what shift does exactly(c standard is pretty vague here)
